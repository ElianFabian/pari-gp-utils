# pari-gp-utils
This is simple set of functions and constants to use in PARI/GP.


If the folder "utils" is in the PARI/GP directory to import all the functions and constants use "\r utils/_init.gp", this file reads another to files (_init_functions.gp and _init_constants.gp) that will import the specify functions written in each one (by deafault it reads all the files from functions and constants).
